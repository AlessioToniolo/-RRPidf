# Velocity PID Tuning Tutorial

ðŸš¨ This tuning process requires the use of an external library. This means that you **must** be
using Android Studio. This tutorial will not work with OnBot Java or Blocks ðŸš¨

## What's a velocity PID?

You'll hear the term PID Controller used a lot in robotics. It's relatively simple and pretty
effective at a lot of simple tasks. A PID controller is a form of "closed loop control." This
basically just means you're altering an input to some "plant" based on feedback. This concept
applies to a wide range of actions but we'll take a look at velocity PID control as that is what's
relevant for this year's game. 

So say you have a goBILDA 3:1 1620RPM motor powering a flywheel. You want that flywheel to spin at a
constant speed to ensure consistency between your shots. So you run a `motor.setPower(0.5)`` which
sends 50% of 12v to the motor. The motor is getting a 6v signal (technically not true because of PWM
but that's another topic). The motor should be running at 810 RPM right? That's 50% of 1620RPM.
Chances are, it's not actually running at this speed. There are a number of reasons why: motors have
+- 10% tolerance between them, the voltage-torque curve isn't linear, or the motor is facing some
resisting force(like the inertia of the flywheel) so it takes extra power to get it up to that
speed. So how do we actually ensure that our motor is running at exactly 810RPM? Most FTC motors
come with an encoder built it. This allows for us to measure the velocity of the output shaft. So
with the encoder all hooked up, we know that our motor isn't spinning as fast as we want it to. But
how do we actually correct for this? You slap a PID Controller on it. A PID controller is a pretty
basic controller (despite the daunting equation when you look it up) that basically responds to your
the difference between your measured velocity and desired velocity (error) and will add more or less
power based on error. You just check the velocity every loop, feed the value in the controlled, and
it gives you the power you want to set it to the desired velocity.

## What does it mean to "tune" your PID controller?

The Rev Hub's motor controller actually has it's own internal velocity PID! This means you don't
have to program any of the fancy math for it. The FTC SDK gives you a velocity controller per motor,
for free! The hub uses the internal velocity PID whenever you call
`motor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_USING_ENCODER)`. Whenever you call `setPower()` while the motor
is in the `RUN_USING_ENCODER`, it actually pipes that into a `setVelocity(ticks per second)`
function. However, each motor comes with a set of default PID gains set in the FTC SDK. These gains
are probably not optimal. They're not tuned for your specific system in mind. They'll be okay for
most people. However, if you want the best response/behavior, you're going to want to set your own
PID gains. Finding the set of gains that works for you is called "tuning".

## Installation

This tuning process utilizes three libraries: FTC Dashboard, Jotai, and Road Runner. FTC Dashboard
allows us to live graph the target and set point, giving us a much more intuitive understanding of
the tuning process. Jotai is a helper library that allows for simple Finite State Machine
construction. You need not be concerned about this. We use Road Runner because it comes with a PIDF
controller with the appropriate feedforward model for DC Motors. You may not wish to install the
entire Road Runner library just for this controller. Feel free to replace the controller with one of
equivalent functionality. 

If you are starting from scratch, just download or clone this repo. You need not go through the
following steps.

In your `FtcRobotController/build.release.gradle` file, insert the following: `implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'`

Your file should look something like this:

```groovy
/* FtcRobotController/build.release.gradle */ 

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Inspection:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Blocks:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotCore:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotServer:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:OnBotJava:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Hardware:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:FtcCommon:6.1.1'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'

    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'
}
```

Then, in your `TeamCode/build.release.gradle` file, insert the following:

```groovy
implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.3'
implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'
implementation "com.noahbres.jotai:jotai:1.0.2"
```

Your file should look something like this:

```groovy
/* TeamCode/build.release.gradle */ 

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Inspection:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Blocks:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotCore:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotServer:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:OnBotJava:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:Hardware:6.1.1'
    implementation 'org.firstinspires.ftc:FtcCommon:6.1.1'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'

    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'
    
    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.3'
    
    implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.3.10'
    
    implementation "com.noahbres.jotai:jotai:1.0.2"
}
```

To enable FTC Dashboard, you must copy paste the `FtcRobotControllerActivity.java` file from
[https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard/blob/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/FtcRobotControllerActivity.java](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard/blob/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/FtcRobotControllerActivity.java)
into your own project. The file will be located under `FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/`.
Alternatively, follow the [official FTC Dashboard instructions](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/gettingstarted).

If you're using the built-in PID, copy over the following files into your own `TeamCode` folder:
    - [VeloPIDTuner.java](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/VeloPIDTuner.java)
    - [TuningController.java](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/TuningController.java)

If you're using two mechanically linked motors, copy over the following files into your own
`TeamCode` folder:
    - [LinkedMotorTuner.java](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/LinkedMotorTuner.java)
    - [TuningController.java](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/TuningController.java)
